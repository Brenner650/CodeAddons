# Exile [CiC]red_ned Napf Loot Positions

<b>Manually-Made:</b> Complete loot positions for Napf including extra CUP/AIF which I have been making over a period of time<br><br><br><br>

<b>To Install</b><br>
You can either:<br>
1. Copy whole file contents over the top of your existing loot positions in the server_config file (yes including all the Exile ones as they are already in my file,<br> or<br>
2. Delete all the loot positions from the config file and replace with:<br>
#include "NapfLootPos.cpp" (which i do) and drop file into the server_config PBO file to load directly<br>
Land_Panelak3 seems a little broken<br><br><br>
<b> This is an ongoing process to try to give as complete a list as possible without and floating loot</b><br><br>
