Example: 	My reinforce in static missions looks like this

_group2 =	[
				[X,Y,250],
				1,
				"random",
				"random",
				"bandit"
			] call DMS_fnc_SpawnAIGroup;						// Helicopter support group
			[
				_group2,
				"random",
				_difficulty,
				"bandit",
				[X,Y,200],
				true,
				10,
				false,
				"Exile_Chopper_Huey_Armed_Green",
				[X,Y,500]
