From DMS script header:

/*
	DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E_3DEN_Static
	Created by eraser1

	Check out M3 Editor - 3DEN: https://github.com/maca134/m3e_3den/releases

	Usage:
	[
		_file							// String: The filename (or filepath under the objects folder) that contains the exported M3E objects
	] call DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E_3DEN_Static;

	_file call DMS_fnc_ImportFromM3E_3DEN_Static; // This also works

	This function will simply create the objects from a file that was exported from M3Editor, and return a list of those objects.

>>>>>>> Note: works fine for static missions but for bandit missions you need relative mapping which this function does not do <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
