Launch parameters can be important - like loading certain mods before other ones which depend on it but you can also swap out command lines from editor to server.

This is my editor mod launch line - 
@Exile;@RHSAFRF;@RHSUSAF;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\@Napf Island A3;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\!Workshop\@CUP Terrains - Core;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\@m3e_3den;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\@m3editor;

You can see using the Arma3 main launch and mods not installed by steam means they need a full path rather than ones downloaded from steam workshop which are just the @mod commands.
This is for my Napf server and so requires CUP Terrains but i also load in @m3e_3den and @m3editor, i even sometimes load in @Exilemod_Loot_Position_Creator.
When i am editing, due to some oddities in these pure editing side mods, i always load in 32 bit and in full screen windowed mode, this prevents several issues with the mods not really beign in full control when exporting or saving and iff you are full screen then @m3editor crashes like a boss when saving and the loot position mod wont work in 64 bit.

My actual client side launch for my dev server is 64 bit full screen using:
@Exile;@RHSAFRF;@RHSUSAF;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\@Napf Island A3;D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\!Workshop\@CUP Terrains - Core;

All sounds really easy and obvious and stuff, but people get this kind of thing wrong a lot putting client mods in the server side mod and vice-versa.

My server launches like this:
-servermod="@ExileServer;@infiSTAR_Exile;" 
-mod="@Exile;@RHSAFRF;@RHSUSAF;@CUP_Terrains_Core;@NapfIslandA3;"

-servermod means it runs only on the server side
-mod means clients need to download the mod as well as it being on the server side

I put this in only to remind me that it exists and not everyone understands or knows about it but once you do then you can use it in batch files for your players to launch and connect directly to your server with a click of a batch file, heres one of my old ones:

@echo off

echo [UK][CiC]PVE Exile CiC-Gaming.co.uk
echo --------------------------------
echo by [CiC]red_ned

echo Join the server in .....
