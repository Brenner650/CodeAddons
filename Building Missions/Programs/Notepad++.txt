Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.

General Notes
Notepad++ is probably the most used tool i have on my computer:
It can search/replace not only in the file but in files inside folders.
It can recognise languages and show errors and syntax.
It has multiple tabs and is great at opening large files or keeping information in a tab even if not saved and program is restarted.
It can manipulate data on the page really easily and do tricks i had not seen before with its advanced code replace (like \n for line breaks) and using alt+click highlighting it made life much simpler.
