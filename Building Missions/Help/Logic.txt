Logic in this case means ways of using various paths to get somewhere using things like "if" "else" or even "round(random X)"

1. Simple way to disable chunks of code if sharing missions
(i)	Defined variable - becomes an "if" Defined "then"
	//uncomment to use
	//#define USE_CUP_Items 1
	
useage:

_posWeapons =	[
					#ifdef USE_CUP_Items
						"CUP_Igla_M",
						"CUP_Igla_M",
						"CUP_Igla_M",
						"CUP_Igla_M",
						"CUP_Igla_M",
						"CUP_Igla_M",  
					#endif		
					"Exile_Item_Knife",
					"Exile_Item_Knife",
					"Exile_Item_Knife",
					"Exile_Item_Knife"
				];
				
So if the #define is uncommented this will include all the CUP items in the _posWeapons variable, if it isnt uncommented then it will just use whatever is outside the #idef to #endif statement

>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<
Avoid having the  #ifedf/#endif statement at the end of a list as this affects the last line comma and can break for inexperienced users

2. "If" "then" "else" "=" "==" and all the other syntax required for logic statements

"if" requires something that if is true/false then but doesnt require else as you can do it as a one off > 
(i)		if x=y then {XXXXXX};			> if x equals y then do XXXXXX
(ii)	if !(x=y) then {XXXXXX}; 		> if x DOES NOT equal y then do XXXXXX > "!" means NOT
"then" this is a shortening of "then do"
"else" if your "if" statement isnt fulfilled the then do this instead > if x=y then {XXXXXX} else {YYYYYY};
