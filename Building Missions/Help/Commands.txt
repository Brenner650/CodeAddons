Commands

Spawning a static mission
Sometimes you need to spawn a mission for testing as it could take ages to actually come around

You need to run the command in the admin console so either load it up in InfiSTAR or log in using the Arma 3 process: #login <password>
https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Multiplayer_Server_Commands for more information on that.
*note only 1 person can be in the console at once*

Spawning a static mission
["Some_Mission"] call DMS_fnc_SpawnStaticMission;

Spawning a bandit missions
["some_mission"] call DMS_fnc_SpawnBanditMission;

>>>>>>>>>> Notes <<<<<<<<<<
The mission you are spawning must be in the list of possible missions to spawn.
I have found sometimes there is a little delay especially if you try running the mission immediately after rebooting the server and joining quickly.

You can then do the mission and check for errors
