Commands

Spawning a static mission
Sometimes you need to spawn a mission for testing as it could take ages to actually come around

Spawning a static mission
["Some_Mission"] call DMS_fnc_SpawnStaticMission;

Spawning a bandit missions
["some_mission"] call DMS_fnc_SpawnBanditMission;

>>>>>>>>>> Notes <<<<<<<<<<
The mission you are spawning must be in the list of possible missions to spawn.
I have found sometimes there is a little delay especially if you try running the mission immediately after rebooting the server and joining quickly.

You can then do the mission and check for errors
