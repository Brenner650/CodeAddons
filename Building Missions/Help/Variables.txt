Variables

1.	Private
	Held purely inside the DMS mission or system and not passed on to other parts of Arma/Exile
2.	Public
	Passed through all parts of the Arma/Exile server
3.	Single/Strings
	One value for a variable or a number os single values for one variable

>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<
ALL private variables MUST start with an underscore like _pos in your missions otherwise the server will immediately throw an error!
All private variables MUST be defined as private or you could risk throwing a server error!
>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<
Private variables can be passed through the DMS system and not just used inside the mission running like _pos = [X,Y,Z]; passes through to the central DMS system and doesnt just exist as a variable to define things inside the mission.

1. Syntax
(i). Define as you go
					You can define each private variable on the fly as they are used like this:
					private _objects = [];
					private _vehicle = "Exile_Car_Ural_Covered_Blue";

(ii). Globally define
					Using the same on the fly approach can make things longer and the mission larger and harder to read so I much prefer defining the private variables at the start of the mission
					private = ["_objects", "_vehicle"];
					
		Then code in mission becomes:
					_objects = [];
					_vehicle = "Exile_Car_Ural_Covered_Blue";
					
*	Remember everything must be in quotes with a comma after each item except the final one and the [] must end with a semi-colon (this is a string variable).
