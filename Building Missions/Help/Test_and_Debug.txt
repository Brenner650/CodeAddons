1. Useful to know.

Waiting for missions to spawn so you can test is pain in the bum so the following useful commands are available through the admin console in game.
You can either
1. Use Admin console in Infistar
2. Log into admin console through Arma using #login <password>
https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Multiplayer_Server_Commands for more information on that.
*note only 1 person can be in the console at once*



2. Logging from DMS


(i) The debug mode does still exist in DMS they just took the commented version out but you can add it back in.
1. Open your a3_dms.pbo
2. Edit config.sqf
3. At the top after all the commented out guff just add:
DMS_DEBUG = true;
4. save and repack/upload
It creates huge RPT files in your main server logs so only use for a while


(ii) Logging from inside the mission is also possible, really useful if you are creating variables on the fly to make missions more random.
1. Edit the mission you want to monitor
2. You can use this function to monitor variables:

diag_log format ["Running DMS MISSION %1",_missionName]; 

If you are logging it MUST be run after the variable is actually defined, no point putting it at the top as it wont have the variables yet.
Here's a longer one so you can see lots going through as the %1 referes to the 1st variable after the end quote, you can stack with %2 %3 etc

diag_log format ["nedbandit1 :: Called MISSION with these parameters: >>AI Group: %1 (plus leader) >>Cash: %2 >>Vwin: %3 >>Colour: %4 >>Difficulty: %5 >>Vehicle: %6",_AICount,_cash,_Vwin,_colour,_difficulty,_vehicleP];
